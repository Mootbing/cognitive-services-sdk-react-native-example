* React Native integration with Speech SDK
* The primary dependency for running on Android and iOS is the 'node-libs-react-native' library, see https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-libs-react-native for metro config construction
* An example of using microphone input (confirmed working on Android) now exists in App_mic_input.js. Thanks [@Mootbing](https://www.github.com/Mootbing) and [@maxx06](https://www.github.com/maxx06) for getting this working!
